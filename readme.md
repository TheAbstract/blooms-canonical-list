# Harold Bloom's Canonical List

In the appendix to his controversial book [The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Western_Canon), literary critic Harold Bloom included a catalog of works he considered canonical. 
He later disowned it and thought it was a distraction from the books main intention.
Apparently he made it off the top of his head after it was requested by his editor. 

I didn't know of a place online where you could get the whole list in a tidy format, so I created one.
The file `books.csv` contains all 1511 works listed in the appendix.

## data sample

The head of the `books.csv` file looks like this:

| Author  | Work                                 | Nation                | Age                                   |
